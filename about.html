                </div>
                <p>During the last months I have dedicated my time to studing Ux design and graphics both digital and for print.</p>
                <p>I learned to use some programs from the Adobe suite, as well as having designed with figma, moving then on to the study of the main languages for web development.</p>
                <p>I am currently following the full stack developer course offered by start to impact.</p>

                        <p>It all started a few years ago, when the pandemic hit our country.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately we were all quarantined for a fair period of time and boredom began to hunt us, in those static days spent at home I got closer than ever to the digital world.</p>
                        <p>I discovered more and more about everything that was present in this space and, in a short time, I became passionate about it. </p>

                        </div>
                        <p>At this point, even if I didn't know it yet, I had already unwittingly made my decision. </p>
                        <p>I was going to embark on a journey to learn as much as possible about these new professions that I had "really" discovered for the first time. </p>
                        <p>While I was documenting myself on platforms such as Youtube, Coursera and Openclassroom, I came across a book called "The design of daily things" by Don Norman.</p>
                        <p>Reading it I started to fall in love with the role of the UX designer, so I decided that this would be my first real step into the new world.</p>
                        <p>I went looking for a way to learn more, found a professional course from Google and started my journey.</p>

                        <p>In the same period I managed to find a mentor who could accompany me during my adventure, thanks to her I learned very quickly notions of graphics and to use numerous programs that proved to be essencial in my path.</p>
                        <p>Currently I am dedicating part of my time to learn Full stack developing to acquire new skills that will surely be useful to me also in relation to the world of UX design.</p>
